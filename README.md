# Geolocation Insights: Analyzing User's Google Location History
### with Pandas, Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook

This project utilizes six months of geolocation data collected by Google (67,000 entries) to analyze user's (mine) movements and activities. 

Employing Pandas the data is processed to extract key information, such as:
* longitude
* latitude
* timestamp
* altitude
* probable activity the user (me) was undertaking

Using this information it is possible to create maps depicting where and when I've been, using Matplotlib, Geopandas, and Shapely, as well as to analyzethe observation frequencies, activity frequencies and altitude history.

Color gradients are employed to indicate the recency of each location. Yellow points are the newest dates, dark blue points are the oldest dates.
